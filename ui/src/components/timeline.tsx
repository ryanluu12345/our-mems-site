fateful day where you invited me to join you on your solo trip to Vancouver, none of this would have ever happened.
I'm thankful every day that we are both such 'down' people and were comfortable hanging with a stranger in
a city we are both not from. When I look back at that trip, I think about how you felt so relatable, familiar, and
comfortable. Leaving that trip, it was not a question in my mind that I wanted to be with you, even though initially when
we had that talk on the kayak I was still hesitant. Thanks for not throwing me off the kayak ðŸ˜›. Vancouver really signified
a new beginning and the honeymoon phase. I feel like those 5 days were a full month of us going on dates and learning
more about each other - Bowen Island, the drive up to whistler, taking care of each other, and trying every tasty thing
from crystal mall.`,

      This was the start of your being able to get to know my parents and build a relationship. I am thankful every day
      for your focus on family and ensuring the people in my life are important to you. During this trip is when we had
      the aesthetic photo shoot day in Getty Villa, visited SF and did the whole walking tour around the city, ate so much
      tasty asian food until our bellies busted (shoutout to banh mi), and started off the tradition of going back and forth.`,

      parts of ourselves and lets us immerse ourselves in new experiences and wild times. During the two weeks
      we spent in New York, we stayed in 5 different places (LOL), ate too many bagels to count, got the flu (oof),
      clubbed hard, went mini golfing, saw broadway shows, went to the Museum of Sex, and worked our full work week.
      It's a bit wild thinking back that we did just all that in two weeks, especially while you were going through
      your battle against the flu. You're such a champ! Additionally, what I really appreciated about this trip
      is going through the craziness and hecticness with you. You never fail to bring an energy and toughness
      that I admire so much. The fact that we are so comfortable going to the Museum of Sex and just saying "bet, let's do it"
      is a hallmark of our relationship. We just take opportunities as they come and enjoy the life experience.`,

      myself in Montreal in the freezing cold weather and living in your home for a month really helped warm
      me up. I'm really appreciative that from the start your parents have been so welcoming and loving. I definitely
      understand they had their reservations at first, but I'm glad we were able to slowly work on relationship.
      I really love the traditions we have with your parents to go on day trips on Sunday (very active!), hang out with your
      fam friends (who all cook so well yummm), and hang with your friend groups in Montreal. Thanks for giving
      me a crash course in Canada -- taking me through Quebec City, Ottawa, and Toronto. Thank you so much
      for introducing me to Scandinavian spas. I can never go to a regular spa ever again. In all seriousness,

      the east coast and watching more sports game than I can remember. I think we learned this trip that
      we are not, indeed, hostel people. Victor is so comfortable in this environment and def taught us
      about communal living. The day we hung out with Jaja and then all the NY homies was so iconic in my mind, just

      taking scenic trains all around, dealing with the hectic times in amsterdam, enjoying the Paris experience,
